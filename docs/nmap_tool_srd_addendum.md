# Instability MCP Server - Nmap Tool Output Capture Fix
## Software Requirements Document (SRD) Addendum

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** July 21, 2025  
**Author:** Pentesting Team  
**Priority:** High  

---

## Problem Summary

Multiple nmap-related tools in the Instability MCP server are failing to capture and return actual nmap command output, instead returning only a generic "Success" status message. This renders the tools effectively useless for penetration testing operations where detailed scan results are required.

## Affected Components

The following MCP server functions exhibit the output capture issue:

- `os_detection_scan`
- `quick_port_scan`
- `service_version_scan`
- `comprehensive_scan`
- `nmap_scan` (when targeting remote hosts)

## Problem Symptoms

### Current Behavior
When executing nmap scans against remote targets, affected tools return only:
```
**Tool-** [function_name]
**Result-** Success
```

### Expected Behavior
Tools should return the complete nmap command output including:
- Target host information
- Open/closed port details
- Service version information
- OS fingerprinting results
- Timing and performance statistics
- Any error messages or warnings

### Exception Case
The `nmap_scan` function correctly captures and returns detailed output when encountering macOS security restrictions on local network scans, indicating the error handling path works but the success path does not.

## Root Cause Analysis

The underlying implementation appears to have a defect in stdout/stderr capture for successful nmap executions. The tools are likely:

1. Successfully executing nmap commands
2. Receiving proper exit codes (hence "Success" status)
3. Failing to capture the actual command output streams
4. Only returning execution status rather than scan results

The error handling path works correctly (evidenced by the detailed macOS security restriction output), suggesting the issue is specific to the success case output capture mechanism.

## Proposed Solution

### Technical Requirements

1. **Fix Output Stream Capture**
   - Ensure all nmap-related tools properly capture stdout from nmap command execution
   - Capture stderr for error conditions and warnings
   - Preserve all formatting and structure of nmap output

2. **Maintain Error Handling**
   - Preserve existing error detection and reporting functionality
   - Continue to provide detailed error messages for permission issues, network problems, etc.

3. **Output Format Consistency**
   - Return nmap output in readable format within the MCP response structure
   - Maintain any existing output formatting that works correctly

### Implementation Approach

The fix should focus on the subprocess execution and output capture mechanism used by the nmap wrapper functions. Ensure that:

- Both stdout and stderr are captured from the nmap process
- The captured output is properly returned in the tool response
- Exit codes are still checked for error conditions
- The existing error message formatting is preserved

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

1. **Complete Output Return**
   - All nmap scan functions must return the full nmap command output
   - Output must include all standard nmap sections (target info, port status, service details, etc.)

2. **Error Handling Preservation**
   - Existing error detection and detailed error messages must continue to work
   - Security restriction warnings must still be captured and returned

3. **Format Consistency**
   - Output format should be consistent across all nmap tool functions
   - Nmap formatting and structure should be preserved

### Test Cases

**Test Case 1: Remote Host Basic Scan**
```
Function: nmap_scan
Target: www.tcpiplab.com
Expected: Full nmap output with host discovery, port status, timing info
```

**Test Case 2: OS Detection Scan**
```
Function: os_detection_scan
Target: www.tcpiplab.com
Expected: Complete nmap OS fingerprinting output with confidence ratings
```

**Test Case 3: Local Network Restriction (Regression)**
```
Function: nmap_scan
Target: 192.168.1.0/24 (on macOS without root)
Expected: Detailed security restriction error message (current behavior preserved)
```

**Test Case 4: Service Version Detection**
```
Function: service_version_scan
Target: www.tcpiplab.com
Expected: Full service enumeration results with version information
```

## Priority Justification

This is a **High Priority** issue because:

- The affected tools are core penetration testing functionality
- Current behavior renders multiple MCP functions unusable
- Penetration testers require detailed scan output for decision-making
- The tools appear functional but provide no actionable information

## Success Metrics

- All nmap-related MCP tools return complete command output
- Zero regression in existing error handling functionality
- 100% of standard nmap output sections are captured and returned
- Tools provide actionable information for penetration testing workflows

**Note:** This addendum assumes the underlying nmap installation and execution is working correctly, with the issue isolated to output capture within the MCP server implementation.
